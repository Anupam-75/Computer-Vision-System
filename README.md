# Object Detection System

## Overview
This project implements an object detection system using the YOLOv4 model, designed to work on CPU for portability and scalability. The system performs real-time detection (10â€“30 FPS) on videos, crops detected objects as individual images, and outputs detection details in a hierarchical JSON format.

## Features
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv4.
- Cropped images of detected objects saved to a designated directory.
- Hierarchical JSON outputs describing detected objects and their relationships.
- Modular design for easy extension and customization.
